Hello, Bailey!

Congratulations on an outstanding homework assignment! You've demonstrated your cyberculture framework!

On the same note, you have done a great job indicating potential security risks within the company organization. You were also able to provide your preferred security behaviors for risk mitigation and quantifiable metrics for assessing these behaviors and outcomes. Finally, you were able to identify desired goals and results based on your security measures and precautions! Well done!

This is a fantastic job identifying five employees or departments that can be involved in the plans for projected security measures! You were also able to describe their respective roles and responsibilities as it applies to training and best practices!

We are impressed to see you cohesively present your training structure and overview. Your plans show the frequency and format of execution, including a description of specific topics covered in training and an explanation of how the activity will be measured. You've done a fantastic job with this deliverable!

It is still early enough to begin building your professional portfolio. Include this document for a healthy start, which will help develop your brand!

This is a fantastic start to your 24-week journey. Keep up the excellent work and this smooth flow you've established!
